# ChamaSys - A book-keeping tool for investment groups (Commonly known as Chamas in Kenya)

Investment groups are commonly known as Chamas in Kenya. These groups remain the unbanked informal sector in Kenya. In a recent survey, about 80% of women in Kenya belong to 1 or more investment group (Chama). Members contribute a certain amount after a fixed period of time (failure to which one is fined to encourage financial discipline). The pooled resources are then advanced to members as loans at an agreed interest and the unused resources may be invested.
